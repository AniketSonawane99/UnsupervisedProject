# UnsupervisedProject
Wine Data Clustering Project


In this project, we use the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment wines based on their chemical constituents. The dataset consists of various chemical properties of wines derived from three different cultivars. Our goal is to identify distinct wine segments with similar chemical properties and find the optimal number of clusters.
